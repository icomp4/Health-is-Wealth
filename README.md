## 🛠️ The Tech
- Android compose for cross-platform compatibility
- ROOM Database for local storage

## 👥 The group
- Used Github along with GitHub project to manage todos
- Enforced feature branches connected to issues to keep code separated and clean
- No strict roles, anyone could pick up any todo regardless of if it was front or backend

## 📍 Where we are 
- The app is 99 percent complete
- All major functionality is present
- Only need to change register and login screens to user survey form since there is no cloud database to support login/registration

# 🎯 Did we meet our goal?

- With some more testing and refinement, the project is Google Play store-ready
